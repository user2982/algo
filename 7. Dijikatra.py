ALGORITHM:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted 

graph.

2. The algorithm maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source is known.

3. At each step, it selects the vertex with the smallest known distance, explores its neighbors, and updates 

their distances if a shorter path is found.
